## Overview

ISDD is a state-of-the-art DNS analysis framework that leverages artificial intelligence to discover subdomains through pattern recognition and machine learning. The tool continuously adapts and improves its detection capabilities by learning from successful discoveries, making it increasingly effective with each scan.

## Core Capabilities

### Intelligence & Learning
- Autonomous pattern recognition and learning system
- Self-improving detection algorithms
- Dynamic pattern weighting based on success rates
- Persistent knowledge base with cross-domain learning

### Advanced Detection Methods
- Certificate Transparency (CT) logs analysis
- DNS zone transfer intelligence
- Search engine reconnaissance
- AI-driven pattern mutation
- Cloud infrastructure pattern recognition

### Performance & Reliability
- Highly optimized multi-threaded architecture
- Intelligent resource management
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive verification system

### Analysis & Reporting
- Detailed JSON-formatted reports
- Real-time scan statistics
- Pattern effectiveness analytics
- Cross-scan correlation analysis
